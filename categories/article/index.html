    Abstract     Text mining application is one of the most trending and highly researched areas in social sciences. Todate, library professionals’ knowledge of text mining tools and practice is mainly limited, resultantly,the library community poorly understands the full range of issues related to text mining. This articleprovides information on applying a text mining approach called topic modelling in the library andinformation science domain. Topic modelling is a text mining approach that determines a generativemodel for documents.</p>

    </header>
    Abstract     Research on gender and politics is becoming increasingly mainstreamed within political science. To document this process, we introduce a comprehensive dataset of articles published in 37 political science journals through 2019 that can be considered “gender and politics” research. While a recent related literature has explored the descriptive representation of women in political science by examining authorship and citation patterns, we argue that the identification of publications substantively focused on gender and politics not only illuminates trends but can contribute to broader conversations about substantive representation and methodological diversity in the discipline.</p>

    </header>
    Abstract     The 21 authors of this study, 19 of whom are non-native English speakers, reflect on the barriers to publishing academic journal articles in top international journals. Each author responded to the same set of questions pertaining to educational (PhD) opportunities for emerging scholars, financial conditions for researchers, and challenges in publishing their work. Limited English language skills, lack of research funding, and different research topics were identified as the most significant barriers to publish in the journals.</p>

    Abstract     Purpose: Social interaction applications and reference tools are actively used by researchers to share and manage their research publications. Thus, this paper aims to determine the scholarly impact of selected Indian central universities.
Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed 669 articles having both Dimensions citations and Altmetric attention scores published by 35 Indian central universities for 4 subfields of Computer Science using Altmetric Explorer. This paper determined each university’s contribution in the studied subfields of Computer Science and the correlation among Altmetric attention score (aggregated and individual), Dimensions citation, and Mendeley readership counts for all 669 articles and stratified percentile sets of top 25%, and top 50% of the overall number of articles.</p>

    Abstract     In today’s publish or perish environment, the scholarly impact of a research article holds great importance. The present study examined 2343 articles having both altmetric attention scores and citations published by 22 core health care policy faculty members at Harvard Medical School. Web of Science was used to retrieve the citations, whereas Altmetric Explorer was used to determine the altmetric attention score. The evaluation metrics in this study were focused on article-level information to determine each faculty member’s contribution to the health care policy department collected in November 2018.</p>

This study presents a solution to the problem by applying topic mining and prediction modeling to 441 full-text ETDs extracted from the PQDT Global database during 2014-2018 in the field of library science using the RapidMiner platform. This study was divided into three phases.</p>

    Abstract     The present paper describes the importance and usage of metadata tagging and prediction modeling tools for researchers and librarians. 387 articles were downloaded from DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology (DJLIT) for the period 2008-17 excluding guest editorials and special editions. This study was divided into two phases. The first phase determined the core Topics from the research articles using Topic-Modeling-Tool (TMT) , which was based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), whereas the second phase employed prediction analysis using RapidMiner toolbox to annotate the future research articles on the basis of the modeled topics.</p>
