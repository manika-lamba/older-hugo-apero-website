&lt;p&gt;The study analyses papers published in DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology (DJLIT) using bibliometric techniques for the period of 1992-2019 (28 years) and citations received by these papers until 20th March 2020as reflected by Google Scholar. The study examined the pattern of growth, geographical distribution of the articles; identified the prolific authors &amp;amp; institutions, and their output; and the pattern of citations of the papers and identified most cited authors. The findings indicate that the highest number of articles was published during 2012-2015 followed by 2016-2019. The distribution of output by countries indicates that 39 countries contributed 1,698 articles, including India. Indian authors published the highest percentage (86.1 %) of articles followed by USA and had the highest value of CPP and RCI. Authors affiliated to different institutions of Delhi contributed the most (30.7 %) followed by Karnataka (13.1 %) and Maharashtra (10.5 %). Among the institutions, DRDO-DESIDOC and CSIR-NISTADS topped the list. Among the 26 most prolific authors, B.M. Gupta (CSIR-NISTADS) published the maximum number of articles. However, B.R. Babu (University of Madras, Chennai) had the highest value of CPP and RCI. During the studied period, 1,698 papers obtained 15,538 citations, of which 248 (14.6 %) articles did not receive any citation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s publish or perish environment, the scholarly impact of a research article holds great importance. The present study examined 2343 articles having both altmetric attention scores and citations published by 22 core health care policy faculty members at Harvard Medical School. Web of Science was used to retrieve the citations, whereas Altmetric Explorer was used to determine the altmetric attention score. The evaluation metrics in this study were focused on article-level information to determine each faculty member’s contribution to the health care policy department collected in November 2018. This paper further determined the predictive capability of altmetric attention score for the increase of citations from November 2018 to January 2020. The findings showed J. Michael McWilliams (Professor); Anupam B. Jena (Associate Professor); and Zirui Song (Assistant Professor) were the faculty members with highest altmetric attention score while Ronald C. Kessler (Professor); Nicole Maestas (Associate Professor); and Zirui Song (Assistant Professor) were the faculty members with the highest citation value. The lowest percentage (5.84%) of articles without any citations were published by the professors, whereas the lowest percentage (4.84%) of articles without any social media mention were published by the assistant professors. The health care faculty had the highest percentage of Mendeley readerships followed by tweets, news, and blogs mention in comparison to a meager percentage of policy-related documents mention for their retrieved articles. A significant strong positive correlation (rR &amp;gt; 0.4) was observed between the aggregated ranked altmetric attention scores and ranked citation/increased citation values for all the faculty members. This study can be extended to determine the research productivity of any department, discipline, or group of faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information explosion in the form of ETDs poses the challenge of management and extraction of appropriate knowledge for decision making by information practitioners. This study presents a solution to the problem by applying topic mining and prediction modeling to 441 full-text ETDs extracted from the PQDT Global database during 2014-2018 in the field of library science using the RapidMiner platform. This study was divided into three phases. In the first phase, metadata analysis of the ETDs retrieved from the database was performed to identify the association of various entities such as universities, departments, types of degrees, and geographical areas with the ETDs. In the second phase, 8 core topics namely children literature; academic library; information retrieval; archival science; user study; digital library; library leadership; and digital communication were determined using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and each ETD was then annotated with the modeled topic. Lastly, a prediction model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was created to classify the untagged ETDs going to be submitted in the database under the 8 modeled topics (a to h).&lt;/p&gt;
