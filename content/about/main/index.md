  I am a scholar of information science with a focus of using computational methods in social science. My research focuses on information retrieval, digital libraries, social informatics, and scholarly communication using text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. I have worked extensively with textual data. My work combines qualitative and quantitative methods, including  focus groups, survey and field experiments, and computational approaches.  

  In addition to publishing scholarly articles, I have authored a book on [Text Mining for Information Professionals](https://textmining-infopros.github.io/).
