## Abstract
This chapter presents a method for analyzing text data called topic modeling and applying it to the field of Library and Information Science. It describes the importance and usage of topic mining for researchers and librarians. An experiment study is also covered which applies topic modeling in a real scenario, where five model topics for the articles published in DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology for the year 2017 using Topic-Modeling-Toolkit and prediction modeling is constructed using RapidMiner toolbox.
