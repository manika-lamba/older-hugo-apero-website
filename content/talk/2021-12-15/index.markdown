abstract: This webinar will provide a brief introduction to The Carpentries instructional philosophy of researcher-to-researcher computational training. We’ll then discuss Author Carpentry, an independent set of modules that can be integrated into a Carpentries Workshops or taught as an independent curriculum. They cover topics not traditionally included in a Carpentry Workshop, such as open authorship, writing in standard formats like Markdown, creating a reproducible and interactive report in RStudio, digital object identifiers, and ORCID IDs. We’ll discuss the future of Author Carpentry and ways you can be involved in the development of this open curriculum.
