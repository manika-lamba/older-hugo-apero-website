## About the Project
The South Asia Chapter (ASIS&T) has been granted the [ASIS&T Special Project Fund](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asist.org%2F2021%2F06%2F17%2Fchapter-special-project-funds-awarded%2F) of $7000 for the year 2021-22 on the project ‘Dealing with COVID-19 and saving people’s lives in South Asia (SA) areas & beyond - A health informatics promotion project’. The Chapter has set up a [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-pt07aaW07tWg7InS2dSDg) to host multilingual videos for disseminating awareness on a variety of topics on COVID-19 in the South Asia region. We have collaborated with the Asia Pacific Chapter and European Chapter to bring their experiences in dealing with similar viruses in the past. Through this channel, we propose to help in fighting misinformation and disinformation regarding COVID-19 information by citing accurate and reliable sources of information.

## Aim & Mission
The goals of this health informatics project are:

1. To spread awareness about COVID-19 issues and behavior.
2. To share the experience of countries with experience of dealing with similar viruses.
3. To help inform people by identifying pertinent topics to deal with COVID-19 highlighting the importance of reliable and accurate information.
4. To identify and share accurate and reliable information from authoritative information sources to fight misinformation and disinformation regarding COVID-19 information.

Through these videos, the Chapter will be able to reach out to the masses in the South Asia region highly impacted by COVID-19. The videos will help in spreading awareness about critical COVID-19 care precautions. The topics of the videos will provide accurate & reliable information thereby helping to fight misinformation and disinformation regarding COVID-19. These videos will act as a bridge connecting information with practice- a core principle of ASIS&T.

A total of 10 videos on a wide range of topics related to COVID-19 such as ‘Myths about COVID-19 vaccines’; ‘Stay safe from COVID1-9 without or before vaccination’; ‘Vaccine Facts: All you need to know about them’; ‘Myths about COVID-19’ will be added. These multilingual videos are available in five languages- Bangla, English, Hindi, Urdu, and Sinhala. We further collaborate with the creator of ‘Buddysuaurs’ to incorporate videos on the topic ‘Things to do in self-isolation’.

To capture the experiences of children during COVID-19 the project will organize a [**series of workshops**](https://www.asist.org/2021/10/15/international-digital-story-writing-competition/) that will culminate in creative writing and drawing competitions in the South Asia region for primary and secondary school children.
